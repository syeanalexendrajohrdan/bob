    # JUMP - THE - JUMP #

the selected pet will move from left to right automatically 
there will be two obstacle 
1. the gap
	-you jump over the gap 
	-if you fell under the gap - you fail

2.the block
	- you jump over the block
	- you touch it - you fail
	
how the jump will be jump 
	- window => space bar
	-mobile =>  tap the screen or jump button (but I prefer tap the screen to jump) 
	
there will be 5 different game levels (*should be fair though*)
	-increase selected pet automated speed
	- more obstacle (but  should fair - keep the game fun - just make it more exciting)
	- longer game time
